 *
 * SquashFS stores directory listings and inode structures separated from
 * each other in meta data blocks.
 *
 * The sqfs_dir_reader_t abstracts access to the filesystem tree in a SquashFS
 * through a fairly simple interface. It keeps two meta data readers internally
 * for reading directory listings and inodes. Externally, it offers a few
 * simple functions for iterating over the contents of a directory that
 * completely take care of fetching/decoding headers and sifting through the
 * multi level hierarchie used for storing them on disk.
 *
 * See @ref sqfs_dir_writer_t for an overview on how directory entries are
 * stored in SquashFS.
 *
 * The reader also abstracts easy access to the underlying inodes, allowing
 * direct access to the inode referred to by a directory entry.

	 * components when looking up a full path.
