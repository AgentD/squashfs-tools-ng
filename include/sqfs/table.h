 * @param location The absolute position of the location list.
 * @param lower_limit The lowest "sane" position at which to expect a meta
 *                    data block. Anything less than that is interpreted
 *                    as an out-of-bounds read.
 * @param upper_limit The highest "sane" position at which to expect a meta
 *                    data block. Anything after that is interpreted as an
