 * @brief Abstracts writing of extended attributes to a SquashFS filesystem.
 *
 * This data structure provides a simple, abstract interface to recording
 * extended attributes that hads out 32 bit tokens required for inodes to
 * refere to them.
 *
 * Use @ref sqfs_xattr_writer_begin to start a block of key-value pairs, then
 * add the individual pairs with @ref sqfs_xattr_writer_add and finaly use
 * @ref sqfs_xattr_writer_end which returns the required token.
 *
 * Finally, use @ref sqfs_xattr_writer_flush to have the extended attributes
 * written to disk.
 *
 * The writer internally takes care of propper deduplication and packaging
 * everything up in compressed meta data blocks in the multi-level hierarchy
 * used by SquashFS. See @ref sqfs_xattr_reader_t for a brief overview on how
 * SquashFS stores extended attributes.
