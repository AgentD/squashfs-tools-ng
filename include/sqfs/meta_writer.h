 * @brief Abstracts generating of meta data blocks, either in memory or

 *
 * SquashFS stores meta data by dividing it into fixed size (8k) chunks
 * that are written to disk with a small header indicating the on-disk
 * size and whether it is compressed or not.
 *
 * Data written to meta data blocks doesn't have to be alligned, i.e.
 * SquashFS doesn't care if an object is written across two blocks.
 *
 * The main task of the meta data writer is to provide a simple append
 * function that transparently takes care of chopping data up into blocks,
 * compressing the blocks and pre-pending a header.
