 *
 * @brief Abstracts generating of directory entries
 *
 * SquashFS stores directory entries and inodes seperated from each other. The
 * inodes are stored in a series of meta data blocks before another series of
 * meta data blocks that contain the directory entries. Directory inodes point
 * to meta data block (and offset) where its contents are listed and the
 * entries in turn point back to the inodes that represent them.
 *
 * There are some rules to this. Directory entries have to be written in
 * ASCIIbetical ordering. Up to 256 entries are preceeded by a header. The
 * entries use delta encoding for inode numbers and block locations relative to
 * the header, so every time the inodes cross a meta data block boundary, if
 * the difference in inode number gets too large, or if the entry count would
 * exceed 256, a new header has to be emitted. Even if the inode pointed to is
 * an extended type, the entry in the header still has to indicate the base
 * type.
 *
 * In addtion to that, extended directory inodes can contain an index for
 * faster lookup. The index points to each header and requires a new header to
 * be emitted if the entries cross a block boundary.
 *
 * The dir writer takes care of all of this and provides a simple interface for
 * adding entries. Internally it fills data into a meta data writer and
 * generates an index that it can, on request, write to another meta data
 * writer used for inodes.
