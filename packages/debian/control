Package: squashfs-tools-ng
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: New set of tools for working with SquashFS images
 SquashFS is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux, optimized
 for small size and high packing density. It is widely used in embedded
 systems and bootable live media.
 .
 SquashFS supports many different compression formats, such as zstd, xz,
 zlib or lzo for both data and metadata compression. It has many features
 expected from popular filesystems, such as extended attributes and support
 for NFS export.
 .
 As the name suggests, this is not the original user space tooling for
 SquashFS. Here are some of the features that primarily distinguish this
 package from the original:
   - reproducible SquashFS images, i.e. deterministic packing without
     any local time stamps,
   - Linux `gen_init_cpio` like file listing for micro managing the
     file system contents, permissions, and ownership without having to
     replicate the file system (and especially permissions) locally,
   - support for SELinux contexts file (see selabel_file(5)) to generate
     SELinux labels.
