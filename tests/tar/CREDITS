The tar archives in this directory have been obtained from here:

    git commit hash a2110a6

This repository was linked in the following article on interoperability of
various different tar programs:

    https://dev.gentoo.org/~mgorny/articles/portability-of-tar-features.html

The original intention of the example archives was to test various tar programs
for interoperability with each others extensions and format quirks.

The following have been removed since there is no intention in adding support
for those features:

 - volume-label tests
 - multi-volume tests
