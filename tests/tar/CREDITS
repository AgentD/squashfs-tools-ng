The tar archives in this directory have been obtained from here:

    https://github.com/mgorny/tar-test-inputs

    git commit hash a2110a6

This repository was linked in the following article on interoperability of
various different tar programs:

    https://dev.gentoo.org/~mgorny/articles/portability-of-tar-features.html

The original intention of the example archives was to test various tar programs
for interoperability with each others extensions and format quirks.

The following have been removed since there is no intention in adding support
for those features:

 - volume-label tests
 - multi-volume tests
 - longe user + group names
 - sun tar samples
 - star samples
 - file flags tests

In addition to that, the files in "file-size" are truncated, since we are only
interested in parsing the header.

The following addtional files have been added:
 - xattr/xattr-shily-binary.tar
     Created from xattr/xattr-shily.tar by manually patching in a capability
     xattr key/value pair.
 - tar/format-acceptance/link_filled.tar
     Contributed in GitHub issue #64. A tar ball that contains a hard link
     where the 100 byte target field is completely filled without containing
     a null-terminator.
