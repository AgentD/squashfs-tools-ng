 1) Parallel Compression Benchmark
 *********************************

 1.1) How was the Benchmark Performed?

 An optimized build of squashfs-tools-ng was compiled and installed to a tmpfs:

  $ mkdir /dev/shm/temp
  $ ln -s /dev/shm/temp out
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure CFLAGS="-O3 -Ofast -march=native -mtune=native" \
                LDFLAGS="-O3 -Ofast" --prefix=$(pwd)/out
  $ make -j install
  $ cd out

 A SquashFS image to be tested was unpacked in this directory:

  $ ./bin/sqfs2tar <IMAGE> > test.tar

 And then repacked as follows:

  $ time ./bin/tar2sqfs -j <NUM_CPU> -c <COMPRESSOR> -f test.sqfs < test.tar


 Out of 4 runs, the worst wall-clock time ("real") was used for comparison.


 For the serial reference version, configure was re-run with the option
 --without-pthread, the tools re-compiled and re-installed.


 1.2) What Image was Tested?

 A Debian image extracted from the Debian 10.2 LiveDVD for AMD64 with XFCE
 was used.

 The input size and resulting output sizes turned out to be as follows:

  - As uncompressed tarball:           ~6.5GiB (7,008,118,272)
  - As LZ4 compressed SquashFS image:  ~3.1GiB (3,381,751,808)
  - As LZO compressed SquashFS image:  ~2.5GiB (2,732,015,616)
  - As zstd compressed SquashFS image: ~2.1GiB (2,295,017,472)
  - As gzip compressed SquashFS image: ~2.3GiB (2,471,276,544)
  - As lzma compressed SquashFS image: ~2.0GiB (2,102,169,600)
  - As XZ compressed SquashFS image:   ~2.0GiB (2,098,466,816)


 The Debian image is expected to contain realistic input data for a Linux
 file system and also provide enough data for an interesting benchmark.


 1.3) What Test System was used?

  AMD Ryzen 7 3700X
  32GiB DDR4 RAM
  Fedora 31


 1.4) What software version was used?

 squashfs-tools-ng v0.9

 TODO: update data and write the *exact* commit hash here.

 1.6) Discussion

 Most obviously, the results indicate that LZ4, unlike the other compressors,
 is clearly I/O bound and not CPU bound and doesn't benefit from parallelization
 beyond 2-4 worker threads and even that benefit is marginal with efficiency
 plummetting immediately.


 The other compressors are clearly CPU bound. Speedup increases linearly until
 about 8 cores, but with a slope < 1, as evident by efficiency linearly
 decreasing and reaching 80% for 8 cores.

 A reason for this sub-linear scaling may be the choke point introduced by the
 creation of fragment blocks, that *requires* a synchronization. To test this
 theory, a second benchmark should be performed with fragment block generation
 completely disabled. This requires a new flag to be added to tar2sqfs (and
 also gensquashfs).


 Using more than 8 jobs causes a much slower increase in speedup and efficency
 declines even faster. This is probably due to the fact that the test system
 only has 8 physical cores and beyond that, SMT has to be used.


 It should also be noted that the thread pool compressor with only a single
 thread turns out to be *slightly* faster than the serial reference
 implementation. A possible explanation for this might be that the fragment
 blocks are actually assembled in the main thread, in parallel to the worker
 that can still continue with other data blocks. Because of this decoupling
 there is in fact some degree of parallelism, even if only one worker thread
 is used.


 As a side effect, this benchmark also produces some insights into the
 compression ratio and throughput of the supported compressors. Indicating that
 for the Debian live image, XZ clearly provides the highest data density, while
 LZ4 is clearly the fastest compressor available.

 The throughput of the zstd compressor is comparable to gzip, while the
 resulting compression ratio is closer to LZMA.

 Repeating the benchmark without tail-end-packing and with fragments completely
 disabled would also show the effectiveness of tail-end-packing and fragment
 packing as a side effect.
