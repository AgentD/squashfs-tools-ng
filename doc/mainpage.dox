/**
 * @mainpage libsquashfs API reference
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * The libsquashfs library attempts to encapsulate the actual core of the
 * SquashFS reading and writing logic of the squashfs-tools-ng package,
 * while trying to offer a generic API that should cover a broad variety of
 * applications that might want to make use SquashFS.
 *
 * All disk I/O is abstracted away through the \ref sqfs_file_t interface. A
 * reference implementation that uses native file I/O can be instatiated
 * using @ref sqfs_open_file. Providing a custom implementation allows reading
 * or writing SquashFS images to something other than regular files, embedding
 * SquashFS in a custom container format or applying custom transformations on
 * the raw byte level.
 *
 * If want to get started with reading SquashFS images, a good starting point
 * would be the @ref sqfs_data_reader_t and @ref sqfs_dir_reader_t that
 * provide an interface for browsing a SquashFS directory tree and reading
 * data contained within.
 *
 * A few helper structures are need for that tough, specifically the SquashFS
 * super block (see @ref sqfs_super_t) that can be read from a
 * @ref sqfs_file_t using @ref sqfs_super_read.
 *
 * A decompressor (see @ref sqfs_compressor_t) is also needed, which can be
 * created using @ref sqfs_compressor_config_init and
 * @ref sqfs_compressor_create.
 *
 * @example list_files.c
