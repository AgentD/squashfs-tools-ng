/**
 * @mainpage libsquashfs API reference
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * The libsquashfs library attempts to encapsulate the actual core of the
 * SquashFS reading and writing logic of the squashfs-tools-ng package,
 * while trying to offer a generic API that should cover a broad variety of
 * applications that might want to make use SquashFS.
 *
 * All disk I/O is abstracted away through the \ref sqfs_file_t interface. A
 * reference implementation that uses native file I/O can be instatiated
 * using @ref sqfs_open_file. Providing a custom implementation allows reading
 * or writing SquashFS images to something other than regular files, embedding
 * SquashFS in a custom container format or applying custom transformations on
 * the raw byte level.
 *
 * @example list_files.c
