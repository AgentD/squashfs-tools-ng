.SH NAME
sqfs2tar \- turn a squashfs image into a tar archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sqfs2tar
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR...] \fI\,<sqfsfile>\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a squashfs archive and turn it into a tar archive, written to stdout.

The idea is to quickly and painlessly turn a squashfs filesystem image into
a tar archive that can then be examined and processed by any tool that can
work on tar archives.
.PP
Possible options:
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR
Print help text and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR, \fB\-V\fR
Print version information and exit.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
To be compatible with as many tools as possible, the output format is pre-POSIX
ustar archive using GNU extensions where necessary. This seems to be more
widely supported by many tar programs (besides GNU tar), even more than the
newer POSIX format and PAX extensions.

It is not possible to store socket files in a tar or pax archive. Also, in the
current implementation, all extended attribuates are lost.

If any file or directory is encountered that cannot be converted, it is
skipped and a warning is written to stderr.
.SH EXAMPLES
Turn a squashfs image into a tar archive:
.IP
sqfs2tar rootfs.sqfs > rootfs.tar
.TP
Turn a squashfs image into a gzip'ed tar archive:
.IP
sqfs2tar rootfs.sqfs | gzip > rootfs.tar.gz
.TP
Turn a squashfs image into an LZMA2 compressed tar archive:
.IP
sqfs2tar rootfs.sqfs | xz > rootfs.tar.xz
