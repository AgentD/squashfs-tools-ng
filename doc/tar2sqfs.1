.SH NAME
tar2sqfs \- create a squashfs image from a tar archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tar2sqfs
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR...] \fI\,<sqfsfile>\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read an uncompressed tar archive from stdin and turn it into a squashfs
filesystem image.

The idea is to quickly and painlessly turn a tar ball into a squashfs
filesystem image, so existing tools that work with tar can be used for
squashfs.
.PP
Possible options:
.TP
\fB\-\-compressor\fR, \fB\-c\fR <name>
Select the compressor to use.
Run \fBtar2sqfs \-\-help\fR to get a list of all available compressors
and the default selection.
.TP
\fB\-\-comp\-extra\fR, \fB\-X\fR <options>
A comma seperated list of extra options for the selected compressor. Specify
\fBhelp\fR to get a list of available options.
.TP
\fB\-\-force\fR, \fB\-f\fR
Overwrite the output file if it exists.
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
Do not print out progress reports.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR
Print help text and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR, \fB\-V\fR
Print version information and exit.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Currently the tool can only process POSIX tar archives with pax extensions, so
you need to tell your tool that generates the tar ball to not use any other
extensions.

For GNU tar, this can be done with the flag \fB\-\-posix\fR:
.IP
tar cf file.tar \-\-posix bin/ lib/ etc/ usr/
.TP
Furthermore, hard links and sparse files are currently not supported. If any
unsupported section is encountered in a tar archive, the section is skipped and
a warning message is written to stderr.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Turn an uncompressed tar archive into a squashfs image:
.IP
tar2sqfs rootfs.sqfs < rootfs.tar
.TP
Turn a gzip'ed tar archive into a squashfs image:
.IP
zcat rootfs.tar.gz | tar2sqfs rootfs.sqfs
.TP
Turn an LZMA2 compressed tar archive into a squashfs image:
.IP
xzcat rootfs.tar.xz | tar2sqfs rootfs.sqfs
